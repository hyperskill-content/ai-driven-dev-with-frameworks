# ðŸš€ From Simple Pages to Scalable Apps

This is a step-by-step learning project for non-technical founders, indie hackers, and creators who want to build web applications using AI-powered workflows â€” without writing code manually.

The project guides you through the fullstack development process from scratch:  
starting with basic HTML pages, and evolving into a real production-ready app with authentication, payments, a database, and deployment.

You'll discover how frameworks simplify development, learn to work with AI coding assistants, and build a real subscription-based app from scratch. Each step builds on the previous one, giving you a clear understanding of how modern development works.

In each step, you'll:

âœ… See prompt examples for generating code with AI agents

âœ… Get clear explanations of why frameworks matter and how they work

âœ… Build a real project with authentication, payments, and content management

You'll learn not by reading long docs, but by writing prompts â€” and analyzing the results.
