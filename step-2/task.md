# Step 2 ‚Äî Moving to React with Next.js & Tailwind CSS

In this step we rebuild the static article list using **React components** and **Next.js** to handle navigation between pages. Apply consistent styling using **Tailwind CSS**.

This step shows how frameworks can simplify structure, reuse, and navigation as your app grows ‚Äî especially when you add more pages like a login screen or a profile.

---

## New App Structure

You'll create a small app with the following pages:

- `/` ‚Äî Home: displays the list of articles
- `/login` ‚Äî Login form (mock only for now)
- `/profile` ‚Äî Profile page (stub for now)

We'll generate a multi-page app using Next.js routing. Each page will use React components and be styled using Tailwind.

---

## Why This Matters

As you grow beyond one page, your HTML starts to repeat itself:
- Header/footer duplicated everywhere
- JS logic scattered or duplicated
- Navigation is manual (`window.location.href`)

React and Next.js solve this with:
- **Reusable components** (Header, ArticleCard)
- **Built-in routing** (`pages/login.js`, `pages/profile.js`)
- **Cleaner logic/state handling**
- **SSR/SSG options** (we'll explore later)

Tailwind CSS adds:
- Consistent, scalable styling using utility classes
- No need to manually write and maintain large CSS files

## üîÅ Side-by-Side Comparison Example

### üî∏ HTML version

```html
<div class="card">
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>Short description...</p>
  <button onclick="alert('Subscribers only')">Read more</button>
</div>
```

### üîπ React + Tailwind version

```jsx
function ArticleCard({ title, description }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 border rounded-lg shadow">
      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{title}</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-600">{description}</p>
      <button
        className="mt-2 text-blue-600"
        onClick={() => alert("Subscribers only")}
      >
        Read more
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Let's try to code

1. Create a new folder called `frontend` in your project root.
2. Try using this prompt to generate your code.
```plaintext
Use Next.js and Tailwind CSS to create a homepage that shows 6 articles using React components.
Each article has a title, short description, and "Read more" button that shows an alert.
Create a reusable <ArticleCard> component.
Add a basic header and navigation between pages: / (home), /login, /profile.
Use Tailwind for all styling.
Save the resulting files in frontend/ directory.
```

Once the code is generated, you‚Äôll see several new files appear.

Take your time to explore them ‚Äî and if anything feels unclear, don‚Äôt hesitate to ask the AI agent to explain specific parts. You can simply say something like ‚ÄúWhat does this file do?‚Äù or ‚ÄúCan you walk me through this function?‚Äù

After that, you can compare your result with the example in the repository to better understand how everything works and see if there are any differences.
