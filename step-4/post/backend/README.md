```

## üêõ Error Handling Example

If you access a non-existent route, you'll get a JSON error response:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/unknown
```
**Response:**
```json
{"error":{"message":"Cannot GET /unknown"}}
```

## üí° Tips
- You can edit the sample data in each route module in `routes/`.
- Use environment variables by creating a `.env` file (see dotenv docs).
- For real authentication, user management, and payments, connect to a database and payment provider in future steps.
